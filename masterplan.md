Masterplan: Accounting Web App
App Overview
The application is a simple accounting tool for non-technical users, designed to help manage accounts, customers, sales invoices, and financial reports. The app will be lightweight, with a focus on usability and core accounting functionalities.

Objective
To provide a simple, local, and easy-to-use accounting solution for small business owners or individuals, allowing them to track income/expenses, generate invoices, and view financial reports.

Target Audience
Non-technical users: Small business owners, freelancers, or individuals who need basic accounting management without complex features.

Core Features & Functionality
User Authentication:

Basic authentication (single user login with username/password).

Session-based login management to keep users logged in.

Account Management:

Ability to add and manage various accounts (bank, credit card, cash, etc.).

Users can track financial transactions through these accounts.

Customer Management:

Users can add and manage customer details such as name, phone number, address, and account details.

Sales Invoice Management:

Users can create and manage invoices, linking them to customers and accounts.

Each invoice will contain items (name, quantity, price) and calculate the total including taxes.

Financial Reporting:

Ability to generate reports by date (year or month) showing:

Profit/Loss

Income vs Expenses (charts)

Top Customers (based on revenue)

Visual reports will be generated using Chart.js (bar charts, line charts, etc.).

Backup & Restore:

Local backup feature to save JSON/CSV data.

Manual restore option, allowing users to upload backup files to recover data.

UI Design Principles
Simple and Intuitive: The app will be designed with a focus on ease of use, ensuring that non-technical users can easily navigate and perform tasks.

Responsive Design: The UI will be responsive, ensuring compatibility across devices (desktop and mobile).

Bootstrap or Tailwind: Both Bootstrap and Tailwind will be considered for styling, with Tailwind CSS being the recommended choice due to its flexibility and modern design approach.

Data Model Concept
Customer:

first_name, last_name, company, mobile, address, credit_cards, bank_accounts.

Account:

name, type (bank, cash, credit card), number, zone.

Invoice:

date, items (name, quantity, unit price), total, tax.

Technical Stack Recommendations
Frontend:

HTML, CSS (Tailwind or Bootstrap), JavaScript (for interactivity).

Chart.js for generating financial reports and charts.

Backend:

Python for the backend logic (Flask or minimal Python HTTP server).

Data will be stored in JSON files (for simplicity and portability).

Authentication:

Use session-based authentication with Python libraries for managing user sessions (like Flask-Login).

Backup & Restore:

Local storage of data files in JSON format.

Manual restore functionality via file upload.

Security Considerations
Basic Authentication: Secure user login with basic username/password.

Backup File Integrity: Ensure backup files are not tampered with, and implement file validation before restoring.

User authentication (single user login).

Account management (add/edit accounts).

Customer management (add/edit customers).

Invoice management (create/edit invoices).

Potential Challenges & Solutions
Data Integrity:

Ensure data is not corrupted during backup/restore by validating file formats and structure.

User Experience:

Since it's for non-technical users, keep the interface clean and guide users with helpful messages (e.g., on backup/restore actions).

Future Expansion Possibilities
Multiple users: You could expand to support multiple users and user roles (admin, accountant) in the future.

Cloud Backup: Integration with cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox for automatic backups.

Advanced Reporting: More detailed financial reports, such as cash flow or balance sheet.

Payment Integrations: Integrate with payment gateways for real-time transaction tracking.
